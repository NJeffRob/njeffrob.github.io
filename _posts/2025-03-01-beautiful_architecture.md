title: "The York Minster"
---

I've never been the kind of person to care much for seeing the world. Traveling is stressful, expensive, and at the end of the day what enriches my life is people, not places. It greatly surprised me, then, that when I happened upon the York Minster Cathedral, I stopped dead in my tracks and just stared.

While it no doubt made it obvious that I was a tourist, there was something so incredibly humbling about seeing a structure that was erected long before I had a pulse, and will likely be here long after I return to the earth. What a surreal experience.

I've added a photo here for the reader's convenience, but it really doesn't do justice to what has to be one of the most incredible pieces of architecture I've ever seen. If you get the opportunity to see it or something like it, please do; you won't be dissapointed.
